<h1>30MFF- CAMPUS CATS</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The project is about campus cats and the goal is to create a webpage to host a video of a typical day in the life of the cats.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>The first task was to shoot the video of the cats in public spaces and edit the video within 30 minutes, 15 minutes for recording and 15 minutes for editing. This video was to show how they existed in these public spaces and how campus residents related with them. After shooting the video on our phones, we then edit it to approximately one minute of footage and present it. In creating the website for the video, I experimented with different wireframes before setting on one that the webpage is based on.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2> 
<p>Looking at the wireframe it be, it becomes clear that the webpage strictly follows its structure. It was difficult, to implement simple design patterns like lines and circles and to their positioning right relative to other elements on the webpage. There were numerous times were i had to experiment with different code blocks to get the alignment and positon of sections right. I realized the design of webpages takens time and commitment and only becomes natural with practice.</p>
